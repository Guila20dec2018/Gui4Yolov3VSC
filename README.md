# Gui4Yolov3VSC
My stage project in Visual Studio Code 


Project to build a graphical interface for the Yolov3 neural network in order to make the processes of starting the network to identify objects and 
entities and training easier and more intuitive


Ubuntu 18.04

Nvidia Quadro K2100M


Follow to setup the nvidia drivers, cuda toolkit, cudnn and opencv:

I used visual studio code to develop but it is possible to set up another environment, like intellij for example


Where possible I tried to use java 8

I basically finished the tab to set up the neural network and started doing the one that shows the results of the identification.
I have not given feedback for the download, compilation and start, you have to follow the logs generated by the ide to understand when to proceed.
This graphic feedback is one of the future works.
